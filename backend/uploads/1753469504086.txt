review a website which can lead to vuln and these are the parts that might require user interactivity

view-source:https://www.google.com/

till now what i learnt

always use the url to find things on website ||ctrl+shift+i||ctrl+u(always look for urls and updates(notification about why the app was updated))||note some directories may not show files in developers mode but may reveal wen viewd as page

in order to search anything just do /what ever u found

developers tool kit 

1)debugger//helped me breakpoint like fixing a flashing object
2)network//helped in way a  website interacts with the web
3)inspector///if we wrote none in bloceker thing remember u should rember (we call it source)

floating boxes blocking the page contents are often referred to as paywalls
